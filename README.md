# Obesity

Obesity is a growing public health concern worldwide. 
Data mining techniques can offer precise estimations by analyzing lifestyle and health related factors. 

## Exploration & Feature

- Which demographic factors (such as age, gender) are most strongly associated with obesity levels?
- What lifestyle factors (such as diet quality, physical activity level) contribute significantly to obesity risk?

## Risk Factor

- Specific combinations of lifestyle factors that increase the likelihood of obesity ?

## Predictive Modeling
- can we accurately predict an individual's obesity level based on their lifestyle factors?
- data mining algorithms that perform good in predicting obesity levels ( and specific feature that contribute the most )
- The datasets contain information about the obesity data in 3 countries:
- Peru
- Colombia
- Mexico

It has rought 2k observations with 17 columns.


The primary focus of Data Mining:

- Understand distribution , find the patterns
- Use some descriptive and inferential stats 
- Extract information and validate if they contain values
- Cluster and check whether the separation is significant
- Lookout for anomalies, Trends, Outliers
